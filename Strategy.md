Steps from scratch:

1. Set up some simple pages and react router (home page + some other page)
2. using useEffect, get the data in the homePage component and save to local state
3. Display the products in a list, using a separate component like ProductCard

// Once you have your data and products showing => React part kinda done!

4. Now that we know what data we have, set up a store! and a reducer
5. Move the api call to a thunk action
6. Dispatch action to get data in reducer
7. Set up selector to get data out of the reducer
